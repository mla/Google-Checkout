        * Fixed "buyer_phone" documentation for Google::Checkout::General::MerchantCheckoutFlow
          to indicate it is a boolean instead of a phone number
        * Added the ability to get the acutal XML that was sent to Google for  
          easier logging and troubleshooting with Google support staff
        * Explicitly closed </merchant-checkout-flow-support>, </checkout-flow-support>,
          </checkout-shopping-cart> tags instead of relying on cleanup code
