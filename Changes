	    * get_items() of Notification/NewOrder.pm dies if given a single item

	    * Code now works with 5.6.x
	    * New order notification is broken if shipping or buyer info is missing

1.0.5   2007-05-01

1.0.6   2007-06-04
        * Add support for parameterized URL tracking

1.0.7   2007-06-25

1.1.0   2007-08-07
        * Updated Gift Cert code with full subroutine name to avoid crashing for some user.
        * Added support for <address-filters>, <allow-us-po-box>, <world-area>
        * Fixed "buyer_phone" documentation for Google::Checkout::General::MerchantCheckoutFlow
          to indicate it is a boolean instead of a phone number
        * Added the ability to get the acutal XML that was sent to Google for  
          easier logging and troubleshooting with Google support staff
        * Explicitly closed </merchant-checkout-flow-support>, </checkout-flow-support>,
          </checkout-shopping-cart> tags instead of relying on cleanup code        
        * Thanks to <Jason Terry> for his contributions above in this release
        * Added AddressFilters.pm - basically extended from ShippingRestrictions.pm
        
1.1.1   2007-09-23
        * Use forcearray for anonymous address and item in XMLin.  get_addresses
          dies because XMLin did not return the right data structure when there 
          is only one item or anonymous address.
        * Factory.pm now gives proper error for invalid XML
        * Fixed bug so that it now supports an array of parameterized URLs.
          Added ParameterizedUrl.pm and deprecated ParameterizedUrls.pm.
          (See checkout_example5.pl on how specify multiple parameterized URLs)
        * Corrected AddMerchantOrderNumber.pm synopsis documentation
        * Added postal-area support for shipping and tax
          (See checkout_example5.pl for how to ship to EU countries)
        * Added EU_COUNTRIES to simplify adding EU countries for ShippingRestrictions,
          AddressFilters and TaxTableAreas
